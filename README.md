## 👋 Welcome to the NPGW GitHub 👋

NPGW provides various APIs to help you accept payments on your website or mobile application.

This repository contains NPGW API definition files, represented in the OpenAPI Specification standard (formerly known as Swagger Specification).

The NPGW APIs have been created using the principles of REST. They will accept and return JSON-encoded bodies and responses, while using standard HTTP response codes & authentication.

### Merchant Registration

1. Once you have been successfully setup, our team will provide you with your unique `merchantId`.
2. Additionally a Merchant Service Account will be created for you to access the APIs.

## 📜 Documentation

* Technical Documentation
* OpenAPI specification
* Test cards

### Usage

There are multiple ways you can use the OpenAPI definition to explore the NPGW APIs:

* By using the classic Swagger toolset, upload these definitions to the Swagger Editor or SwaggerHub.
* By using Postman to import the API definition and create your personal collection of requests.
