## 👋 Welcome to the NPGW GitHub 👋

NPGW provides various APIs to help you accept payments on your website or mobile application.

This repository contains NPGW API definition files, represented in the OpenAPI Specification standard (formerly known as Swagger Specification).

The NPGW APIs have been created using the principles of REST. They will accept and return JSON-encoded bodies and responses, while using standard HTTP response codes & authentication.

### Merchant Registration

2. Additionally a Merchant Service Account will be created for you to access the APIs.
