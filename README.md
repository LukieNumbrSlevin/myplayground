ðŸ‘‹ ## Welcome to the NPGW GitHub ðŸ‘‹

This page contains the source code for all of our APIs, SDKs and our Open API specifications for NPGW merchants.

The NPGW APIs have been created using the principles of REST. They will accept and return JSON-encoded bodies and responses, while using standard HTTP response codes & authentication.

### Merchant Registration

1. Once you have been successfully setup, our team will provide you with your unique `merchantId`.
2. Additionally a Merchant Service Account will be created for you to access the APIs.
